# DainorÄ—lis

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm run dev:web
    npm run dev:ios
    npm run dev:android
   ```

For Android and iOS to work, you'll probably have to do some setup:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

3. Make changes

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

I'm not really sure when, but sometimes if stuff isn't working, like external assets or libraries, I clear stuff out with `npx expo prebuild --clean`.
